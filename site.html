    <h1>Basketball Guide For Beginners</h1>
      
    <h2>Introduction and Brief History</h2>
      <p>   Basketball is a team sport that is played by two opposing teams of five players each. The game was first conceived in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, a Canadian-American physical education coach. While working 
         at the YMCA Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts, Naismith wanted to create a game that could be played indoors during the cold Massachusetts winters. Naismith was inspired by a game he had 
         played as a child that he fondly called "duck on a rock". The game consisted of players throwing rocks at a "duck" set up on top of a large rock in an attempt to knock it down. In his new game, Naismith replaced the "duck" 
         with two peach baskets placed 10 feet high, and swapped the rocks for a soccer ball. With that, the game of basketball was born.

      <p>   Now, 140 years later, basketball has become of the most popular sports in the world, played and watched by milions of people across the globe. Of course, the game has changed drastically from Dr. Naismith's version, but the 
         basic premise is the same. If you want to learn more about the game of basketball, this website is perfect for you. This site has sections including a general description of the game, the important rules, the five positions,
