    <h2>Positions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Point Guard</li>
          <p>Point guards are typically the team's best ball handler and passer. They are responsible for facilitating the team's offense. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Paul">Chris Paul</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry">Stephen Curry</a> are two great point guards in the NBA today.</p> 
        <li>Shooting Guard</li>
          <p>As their name suggests, shooting guards are typically good shooters from three point and mid range. They are often referred to as wings because that's where they are usually found on the court. Devin Booker and James Harden are two of the best shooting guards in the NBA right now.</p>
        <li>Small Forward</li>
          <p>Small forwards are the most versatile of the five positions. They are responsible for scoring points and defending. Lebron James and Kevin Durant are two of the best small forwards of all time.</p>
        <li>Power Forward</li>
          <p>Power forwards work mostly in the paint, and score through post moves and mid range jump shots. Giannis Antetokounmpo is the best power forward in the NBA right now.</p>
        <li>Center</li>
          <p>Centers play near the baseline or close to the basket. They are usually the tallest players on the floor, and are typically skilled gathering rebounds, blocking shots, and setting screens. Joel Embid, Nikola Vucevic, and Nikola Jokic are examples of great centers in the NBA.</p>
