    <h2>General Description</h2>
      <p>Basketball is a team sport where two teams of five players each
         try to score by shooting a ball through the other team's hoop. 
         Basketball is played on a rectangular floor called the court, 
         and there is a hoop at each end. The ball is moved around the court 
        by passing or dribbling. Click <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">here</a> to access the basketball wikipedia page.

    <h2>Important Rules</h2>
      <p>A shot that goes in from outside the three-point line is worth three points. All other field goals are worth two points. 
        The player must bounce, or dribble, the ball with one hand while moving both feet. A double dribble is a violation where 
        a player dribbles a basketball, picks it up with both hands, then dribbles again. The ball must stay in bounds. if the ball 
        goes out of bounds, it's given to the opposite team of the team who's player last touched the ball. The player's hand must be 
        on top of the ball while dribbling, or else a carry is called. CLick <a href = "https://www.rulesofsport.com/sports/basketball.html">here</a> 
        for a website that explains the rules more in-depth.

    <h2>Positions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Point Guard</li>
          <p>Point guards are typically the team's best ball handler and passer. They are responsible for facilitating the team's offense. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Paul">Chris Paul</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry">Stephen Curry</a> are two great point guards in the NBA today.</p> 
        <li>Shooting Guard</li>
          <p>As their name suggests, shooting guards are typically good shooters from three point and mid range. They are often referred to as wings because that's where they are usually found on the court. Devin Booker and James Harden are two of the best shooting guards in the NBA right now.</p>
        <li>Small Forward</li>
          <p>Small forwards are the most versatile of the five positions. They are responsible for scoring points and defending. Lebron James and Kevin Durant are two of the best small forwards of all time.</p>
        <li>Power Forward</li>
          <p>Power forwards work mostly in the paint, and score through post moves and mid range jump shots. Giannis Antetokounmpo is the best power forward in the NBA right now.</p>
        <li>Center</li>
          <p>Centers play near the baseline or close to the basket. They are usually the tallest players on the floor, and are typically skilled gathering rebounds, blocking shots, and setting screens. Joel Embid, Nikola Vucevic, and Nikola Jokic are examples of great centers in the NBA.</p>
