                <h2>General Description of Basketball</h2>
                  <p>Basketball is a team sport where two teams of five players each
         try to score by shooting a ball through the other team's hoop. 
         Basketball is played on a rectangular floor called the court that has a
         hoop at each end. Hoops are typically 10 feet off the ground, 
         although some leagues for young children play on shorter hoops that may be 
         8-9 feet tall. Just like there are different kinds of basketball hoops, there 
         are also several types of basketballs and court surfaces. More information on 
         that can be found <a href = "https://basketball91.com/tips/different-types-of-basketballs-and-court-surfaces/index.html">here</a>.
         Players on offense advance the ball down the court by bouncing it up and down while walking or running. 
         This is called dribbling. They can also pass the ball to their teammates. A variety of shots including the lay-up, 
         the jump-shot, and the dunk can be used to score points for your team. A field goal is worth two points, unless it's 
         shot from behind the three-point-line, in which case it is worth three points.
