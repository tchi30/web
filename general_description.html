    <h2>General Description</h2>
      <p>Basketball is a team sport where two teams of five players each
         try to score by shooting a ball through the other team's hoop. 
         Basketball is played on a rectangular floor called the court, 
         and there is a hoop at each end. The ball is moved around the court 
        by passing or dribbling. Click <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">here</a> to access the basketball wikipedia page.
