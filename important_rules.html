    <h2>Important Rules</h2>
      <p>A shot that goes in from outside the three-point line is worth three points. All other field goals are worth two points. 
        The player must bounce, or dribble, the ball with one hand while moving both feet. A double dribble is a violation where 
        a player dribbles a basketball, picks it up with both hands, then dribbles again. The ball must stay in bounds. if the ball 
        goes out of bounds, it's given to the opposite team of the team who's player last touched the ball. The player's hand must be 
        on top of the ball while dribbling, or else a carry is called. Click <a href = "https://www.rulesofsport.com/sports/basketball.html">here</a>
